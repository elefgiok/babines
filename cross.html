WWF has formed an emergency fund to drive critical resources to the people at the front lines of the dramatic fires, specifically to local civil society organizations that represent and work with indigenous peoples and local communities to protect the Amazon. Every dollar you donate will go directly to on-the-ground partners providing fire response and recovery in the world’s largest rain forest.

Then ask them to speak out for protecting the Amazon. Many people living in the Amazon witness environmental destruction that impacts their lives and their well-being, through no fault of their own, but they often lack the means and support to speak out against this.

                                <p class="lead">Make choices that help the planet. Learn how your food and other purchases have been produced. Is your furniture, for example, made of wood from the Amazon? And, if so, is the wood sustainably harvested and certified to prove it?. One of the best ways to protect forests like the Amazon is to buy products that have the FSC® label. Reducing your use of fossil fuels also makes a difference. The less fossil fuels used, the less impact climate change will have on the Amazon and other important natural areas. Support and demand renewable energy be part of the grid in your area. Turn off electric appliances when you’re not using them. When possible, choose green energy providers for your household and take public transport or ride your bike to work.
